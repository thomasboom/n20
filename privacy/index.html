    <section>
        <h2>What information do we collect</h2>
        <p>When using n20, we only collect what's required for the service to work. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The long (original) URL you shortened</li>
            <li>The generated or chosen handle</li>
            <li>The total clicks count on the link</li>
            <li>The creation date of the link</li>
            <li>The last 15 characters of your hashed IP</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How we use your information</h2>
        <p>We only use the collected data to provide n20 services, count clicks, and prevent any abuses or malicious activity.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Data retention</h2>
        <p>We save shortened links and related information until we choose to delete them for any abuse, security reason, or maintenance. The last 15 characters of your hashed IP are stored to prevent abuses, but are never linked to your personal identity.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Sharing and disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not share any of your data with third parties, unless required by law or needed to prevent illegal or abusive activity. We never sell your data for advertising purposes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We implement measures to protect your data and links from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no system can be 100% secure.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Changes to this privacy policy</h2>
        <p>We may change or update this privacy policy at any time. If you continue using n20, it means you accept the updated policy.</p>
